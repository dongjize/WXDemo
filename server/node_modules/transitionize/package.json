  "readme": "# Transitionize\n\n## Description\n\nTransitionize helps you to create CSS3 transitions dynamically to elements of your choice. This helps in cases where you need different transition properties or transition speed for the same element, but for different events, for example.\n\nThe idea came when I needed a simpler way to do that for another project of mine - [Switchery](https://github.com/abpetkov/switchery), where I had to change some of the properties speed when checking/unchecking the switchery.\n\n## Installation\n\n##### Standalone:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"dist/transitionize.js\"></script>\n```\n\n##### NPM:\n\n```shell\n$ npm install transitionize\n```\n\n##### Component:\n\n```shell\n$ component install abpetkov/transitionize\n```\n\n##### Bower:\n\n```shell\n$ bower install transitionize\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar elem = document.querySelector('.js-elem');\nvar prop = { 'key': 'value' };\nvar init = new Transitionize(elem, prop);\n```\n\nTo run the example in this repository, with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) already installed, execute the following command:\n\n```shell\n  browserify examples/browserify.js -o examples/bundle.js\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nYou can make as many keys as you want and they will work as long as they are CSS valid properties.\n\n```js\nvar prop = {\n    'border': '0.3s'\n  , 'box-shadow': '0.3s'\n  , 'text-shadow': '0.8s'\n};\n```\n\nIf you'd like to specify the `transition-timing-function` or the `transition-delay`, do it like so:\n\n```js\nvar prop = {\n  'background-color': '0.3s ease-in 1s'\n};\n```\n\n## Development\n\nIf you've decided to go in development mode and tweak all of this a little bit, there are few things you should do.\n\nAfter you clone the repository, do this in your terminal ([NPM](http://npmjs.org/) required):\n\n```shell\n$ npm install\n```\n\nAdd the following code before the rest:\n\n```js\nvar Transitionize = require('transitionize');\n```\n\nMake sure you're using the `build/build.js` file and you're ready.\n\nThere are some useful commands you can use.\n\n`$ make install` - will install Node.js modules, components etc.\n\n`$ make build` - will create a build file\n\n`$ make standalone` - will create a standalone and minified files\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you like this and want to see more of my work, share your appreciation by following me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abpetkov), [GitHub](https://github.com/abpetkov) or [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/apetkov).\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Alexander Petkov\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
